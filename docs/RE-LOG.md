# Reverse Engineering Log

A running notebook of what we discover as we tear the game apart. New
entries are appended; older entries are not edited (except for fixing
factual errors, which we mark with a struck-through note).

The log is meant to be readable end-to-end by anyone who wants to
understand *how* we got to the C# port — not just the conclusions.

## 1. The target

- **Game**: Subterranean Stryker
- **Year**: 1985
- **Publisher**: Insight Software (UK)
- **Platform**: ZX Spectrum 48 K (single release)
- **Original price**: £6.95
- **Sources**:
  - [Spectrum Computing entry 4983](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4983/ZX-Spectrum/Subterranean_Stryker)
  - [World of Spectrum archive](https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/software/games/subterranean-stryker-insight-software)

Spectrum Computing lists only one release for the Spectrum (the 48 K
version) plus an unofficial Italian magazine reprint ("Missione nel
profondo", Load 'n' Run, Dec 1985) which we are ignoring. There is no
128 K variant, so "the more advanced Spectrum version" is the 48 K
original.

**Confirmed:** Everygamegoing tags the cassette as compatible with both
Spectrum 48K and 128K, but the game's own feature box reads
"48K Spectrum Only" — the 128K tag is just compatibility (the tape
runs in 48K mode on a 128K). There is no separate 128K-exclusive
edition with enhanced audio/graphics. The Spectrum version we are
targeting is the one canonical 1985 release.

**Credits** (from Everygamegoing): code by Mark Wilson and Peter
Gough, music by Tim and Mike Follin. The Follin brothers' involvement
means the AY/beeper tune is a genuine bit of Spectrum music history,
and worth preserving carefully when we get to the audio extraction
step.

## 2. Files in `original/`

```
original/
├── tape/SubterraneanStryker.tzx        49 469 bytes — full tape image
└── dumps/
    ├── SUBSTRYK.Z80                     36 673 bytes — .z80 v1 snapshot
    └── SCRSHOT/SUBSTRYK.SCR              6 912 bytes — loading screen
```

The `.tzx` is the canonical preservation artefact (turbo-loaded tape).
The `.z80` is a v1-format compressed snapshot of the game already
loaded into RAM, taken at some point during the title screen. The
`.scr` is the raw 6 912-byte Spectrum display (256×192 mono + 32×24
attributes).

## 3. Tools we'll need

We are deliberately **not** pulling third-party Spectrum tooling. Every
piece of analysis machinery here will be hand-written so that the open
source release has clean provenance. The tool set will grow as the
project proceeds; current plan:

1. **`unz80`** — decompress a v1 `.z80` snapshot into a flat 48 K
   memory image (one byte per Spectrum RAM byte, addresses 0x4000 –
   0xFFFF mapped to file offsets 0 – 0xBFFF).
2. **`zdisasm`** — a small Z80 disassembler. Just enough to follow
   game code; doesn't need every undocumented opcode at first.
3. **`scrview`** — render `.scr` files (and chunks of memory) as PNGs
   so we can visually identify graphics in the memory image.
4. **`tapread`** — walk a `.tzx` file, list the blocks, and dump the
   data inside each one (this is where the original loader and any
   in-game data live, before depacking).
5. **`sprrip`** / **`maprip`** — once we know the data layouts, rip
   the sprites and maps out.

These all end up under [`tools/`](../tools/). They are written in
small self-contained C# console projects (single .NET solution) so the
whole pipeline is one toolchain.

The runtime port + the asset/map editor live in [`src/`](../src/),
share an `Assets` library with the tools, and target `net8.0`.

## 4. Method

The general loop:

1. Extract the data we have (snapshot, tape blocks).
2. Pull out the obvious assets first (the loading screen is already
   a known format).
3. Disassemble the resident game code; identify the main loop and the
   input/draw/update phases.
4. Walk back from "draw sprite" / "draw map" to find sprite/map
   tables, document their formats, and rip them.
5. Re-implement the gameplay logic in C# against the ripped data.
6. Wire a viewer/editor on top of the same `Assets` library.

Every interesting offset, table, or routine address goes into the
[`docs/MEMORY-MAP.md`](MEMORY-MAP.md) file as we identify it.

## 5. First glance at the snapshot

`subterra snapshot-info` (see [`src/Subterra.Tools`](../src/Subterra.Tools))
reports the following for `SUBSTRYK.Z80`:

```
Kind:           V2
PC: 1F3D    SP: 5E82    IM: 0    Border: 7    IFF1/2: 1/1
AF: 0050    BC: 0000    DE: 395D    HL: 5D34
AF':FF81    BC':0147    DE':369B    HL':0000
IX: 0000    IY: 5C3A    I:  3F      R: 08
```

Observations:

* PC = `$1F3D` is **inside the Spectrum 48K ROM** (the ROM occupies
  `$0000-$3FFF` and is *not* present in the snapshot). The snapshot was
  taken while the CPU was executing a ROM routine — most likely the
  keyboard-scan loop at the title screen, since:
  * `IY = $5C3A` and `I = $3F` are the canonical BASIC/system values
    set up by the ROM,
  * `SP = $5E82` is well above the usual stack base,
  * `IM 0` plus `IFF1/IFF2 = 1` is what the ROM uses for normal
    interrupts.
* Border colour is `7` (white), border colour is set by the ROM at
  startup.
* The byte histogram per 4 KB block shows most of `$4000-$DFFF` is
  zero-padded but the upper region `$E000-$FFFF` is dense — that's a
  good first guess for where the game's resident code/data block
  lives.

We rendered both `SCRSHOT/SUBSTRYK.SCR` and the snapshot's screen
memory (`$4000-$5AFF`). They are identical — confirming that the
snapshot was captured at the title screen rather than during
gameplay. To get a *gameplay* reference frame, we'll need to run the
game ourselves: that's why building a minimal Z80 + Spectrum ULA
emulator is the next big step.

Renders live in [`renders/`](../renders/) with a timestamp suffix so
we keep a complete visual history; never overwrite.

## 6. Tooling so far

`src/Subterra.Spectrum` is a small dependency-free library with:

* `Z80SnapshotReader` — handles v1, v2, v3 .z80 files (RLE decode,
  page mapping); only 48 K mode is supported for now.
* `SpectrumScreen` — Spectrum bitmap-address math + 16-colour palette
  + `.scr → RGBA` decoder.
* `PngWriter` (+ our own `Crc32`) — minimal RGBA PNG encoder so we
  never depend on a third-party imaging library.
* `RenderTarget` — every render in the project goes through this so
  it lands in `renders/` with a timestamp.

`src/Subterra.Tools` (binary name: `subterra`) exposes commands:

```
subterra render-scr <file.scr>
subterra render-snapshot <file.z80>
subterra unz80 <file.z80> <out.bin>
subterra snapshot-info <file.z80>
```

We caught one bug along the way: our first `BitmapAddress(x, y)`
mixed up the position of `y`'s low 3 bits in the bitmap offset,
producing a screen where the title was vertically repeated. The
corrected formula (see [`SpectrumScreen.cs`](../src/Subterra.Spectrum/SpectrumScreen.cs))
puts `y`'s low 3 bits into address bits 10–8 and the next 3 bits of
`y` into address bits 7–5; that produced a correct render on the
next try.
